## 🔄 How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks "🗑️ Delete Paper" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears with paper title
3. User clicks "OK" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
4. If confirmed:
   - Paper is removed from state
   - Dashboard re-renders without the deleted paper
   - Paper count updates automatically
5. If cancelled:
   - Dialog closes
   - No changes made

### Technical Flow
